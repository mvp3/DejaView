# Contributing

Thank you for considering contribution to Deja View!

There are several ways to contribute. This document provides 
some general guidelines for each type of contribution.

## Giving Feedback

The best way to provide feedback is to email me directly at
[truthbearer@gmail.com](mailto:truthbearer@gmail.com). I appreciate 
your interest in this project and help to make it better.

## Suggesting New Features

If you intend to add a new feature or to make large changes, please
discuss this first through a proposal on GitHub. Discussing your idea
enables both you and the dev team that we are on the same page before
you start working on your change. If you have any questions, feel
free to ask for help at any time!

## Reporting Bugs

This kind of contribution is the most important, as it tells where
Deja View has flaws and thus should be improved to maximize stability
and user experience. To make this process as smooth as possible, please
use the premade [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
for bug reporting. This makes it easy for us to understand what the bug
is and how to solve it.
